# zedit-asis-spells
# WARNING: This mod is not ready for use yet!

A zEdit UPF patcher to distribute spells to NPCs, like how the ASIS SkyProc patcher did for Classic Skyrim, now returns in SSE (you can still use it in Classic)!

### How it works

Just like ASIS, it distributes spells based on skill-checking. Only difference (probably) it distributes spells based on Spell Tomes that are in Vendor and Leveled Lists, for immersion (and to avoid breaking your game if some spells don't play nice if not casted by the player).
Works on mod-added spells too!

### Requirements

1. A copy of Skyrim Classic/Legendary/Sepcial Edition
2. zEdit
3. Spell mods (optional, but then having NPC using vanilla spells is boring, no?)
